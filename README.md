# tudat-bundle

This repository facilitates parallel development between the `tudat` (C++) and the
`tudatpy` (Python) library.
Specific indications for documenting `tudat` or `tudapy` are reported in the `tudat-multidoc/README.md` file.


## Structure of the `tudat-bundle`

The `tudat-bundle` comprises the following repositories:

- `tudat`, where the tudat source code is located (this is a separate git repository);
- `tudatpy`, where the tudatpy binding code is located (this is a separate git repository);
- `tudat-multidoc`, where the documentation and the system to build the API is located (this is a separate git repository);
- `cli`, where the Python Command Line Interface scripts to build the API are located;

In addition, once the project is built, all the build output will be dumped in the `cmake-build-debug` directory, which
is not tracked by Git. If the API is also built, more untracked directories will appear, but this is explained in the
`tudat-multidoc/README.md` file.

## Prerequisites

- [**Windows Users**] Windows Subsystem for Linux ([WSL](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/install))
  - All procedures, including the following prerequisite, assume the use of WSL. Power users who wish to do otherwise,
    must do so at their own risk, with reduced support from the team.
  - Note that WSL is a, partially separated, Ubuntu terminal environment for Windows. Anaconda/Miniconda, Python and any other dependencies you require while **executing code** from the `tudat-bundle`, must be installed in its Linux version via the Ubuntu terminal. This does not apply to PyCharm/CLion however, which can be configured to compile and/or run Python code through the WSL.
  - Note that, to access files and folders of WSL directly in Windows explorer, one can type `\\wsl$` or `Linux` in the Windows explorer access bar, then press enter.
  - At the opposite, please follow [this guide](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/wsl2-mount-disk) to access Windows file trough WSL.
  - [This guide from Microsoft](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/setup/environment) contains more information on the possibilities given trough WSL.
  - In the Ubuntu terminal environment under WSL, run the command `sudo apt-get install build-essential` to install the necessary compilation tools
- Anaconda/Miniconda installation ([Installing Anaconda](https://tudat-space.readthedocs.io/en/latest/_src_first_steps/tudat_py.html#installing-anaconda))
- CMake installation
  - Inside the Ubuntu terminal, install CMake by calling `sudo apt install cmake`.

## Setup

1. Clone the repository and enter directory

````
git clone https://github.com/tudat-team/tudat-bundle
cd tudat-bundle
````

> **Note** \
> The `tudat-bundle` repository uses git submodules, which "allow you to keep a Git repository as a subdirectory of
> another Git repository" (from [the Git guide](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Git-Tools-Submodules)). In particular,
> in the `tudat-bundle` there are four different subdirectories that are separate repositories: `tudat`, `tudatpy`,
> `tudat-multidoc` and `tudat-multidoc/multidoc`. Each repository has its own branches and functions separately from
> the others. This is the reason why the following two steps are needed.

2. Clone the `tudat` & `tudatpy` submodules

````
git submodule update --init --recursive
````

3. Switch `tudat` & `tudatpy` to their desired branches using

````
cd <tudat/tudatpy>
git checkout <branch-name>
````
We recommend working with the `develop` branches ([tudatpy/develop](https://github.com/tudat-team/tudatpy/tree/develop), [tudat/develop](https://github.com/tudat-team/tudat/tree/develop)), as they receive frequent updates and are the ones used to build the Conda packages.

4. Install the contained `environment.yaml` file to satisfy dependencies

````
conda env create -f environment.yaml
````

It is possible that the creation of the environment will 'time out'. A likely reason for this is that the packages required cannot be found by the current channel, `conda-forge`. It is then advisable to add the channel `anaconda` to ensure a proper creation of the environment.

There are two directions you can go from here: the command line or CLion.

### Build & Install: Command line

5. Activate the conda environment

````
conda activate tudat-bundle
````

6. Install Tudat and TudatPy

This will let conda know that Tudat and TudatPy exist, even if they have not been compiled yet, and it is required in order to generate tudatpy's stubs.
```
python install.py
```

6. Build Tudat and TudatPy

This script will compile the C++ source code of Tudat into libraries. The process will take some time, but you can speed it up using the option `-j` and the number of cores you want to allocate to it.

```
python build.py -j <number-of-cores>
```
You can further adjust the behavior of `build.py` with additional command line arguments. Running `python build.py -h` will give you a list with all the available options.

7. Uninstall

<!-- Building the libraries from source is conceptually equivalent to manually downloading them as a zip file: you do have the code, but Conda is not aware of it, so you will get an error if you try to import it. The following script creates links to the files generated by `build.py` in the place where Conda will look for them or, in other words, installs your libraries in your Conda environment.

```
python install.py
```

If you know about PIP's editable installs, that is exactly what `install.py` does. If you don't, just know that there is no need to reinstall the libraries when you recompile them or modify the Python source, your environment is automatically updated every time you modify a file. -->

If you ever want to uninstall the libraries, just run `python uninstall.py`. Note that this will not eliminate the build itself, but just remove it from your Conda environment.

### Alternative build: CLion
> **Note**
> - [**Windows Users âˆ© CLion Users**] In CLion, be sure to set WSL as your Toolchain
>  in `File>Settings>Build, Execution, Deployment>Toolchains`.
>
> - [**CLion Users**] In CLion, the convention to set CMake arguments
>  is to add them to `File>Settings>Build, Execution, Deployment>CMake Options`.

5. Open CLion, create a new project from `File > New Project` and select the directory that has been cloned under bullet
   point 1 (named `tudat-bundle`).
> **Note** \
> To avoid issues with CLion, the directory of the project should correspond exactly to the cloned directory named  `tudat-bundle`.


6. Create a build profile in `File > Settings > Build, Execution, Deployment > CMake`.
> **Note** \
> The CMake configuration option `CMAKE_BUILD_TYPE` will be determined by the the build profile's `Build type` entry.
> A `Release` configuration will suppress a significant amount of harmless warnings during compilation. Currently,
> with the move to a later version of boost, some warnings have cropped up that have either not been fixed in the
> source code, or have not been suppressed via `tudat/cmake_modules/compiler.cmake`.

7. Add the CMake configuration to the `File > Settings > Build, Execution, Deployment > CMake > CMake options` text box:

```
-DCMAKE_PREFIX_PATH=<CONDA_PREFIX>
-DCMAKE_CXX_STANDARD=14
-DBoost_NO_BOOST_CMAKE=ON
```

The `CONDA_PREFIX` may be determined by activating the environment installed in step 4 and printing its value:
````
conda activate tudat-bundle && echo $CONDA_PREFIX
````

The following line can also be edited if you wish to build tudatpy with its debug info (switching from `Release` to `RelWithDebInfo`; note that `Debug` is also available):
````
-DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=RelWithDebInfo
````

[**Optional**] Add `-j<n>` to `File > Settings > Build, Execution, Deployment > CMake > Build options` to use multiple
processors. It is likely that if you use all of your processors, your build will freeze your PC indefinitely. It is
recommended to start at `-j2` and work your way up with further builds, ensuring **no unsaved work** in the background.

8. In the source tree on the left, right click the top level `CMakeLists.txt` then `Load/Reload CMake Project`.

9. `Build > Build Project`

<!--
The following line can also be edited if you wish to build tudatpy with its debug info (switching from `Release` to `RelWithDebInfo`; note that `Debug` is also available):
````
-DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=RelWithDebInfo
````

As building can take a while, you can build using multiple processors by appending by modifying your [build.sh](build.sh) script. For instance, you can modify the existing line defining the ``NUMBER_OF_PROCESSORS`` to the following, to use 2 threads for compilation. Note that a single thread may use up to 4 GB of RAM, and using too many parallel threads will make the compilation run out of RAM and terminate.
````
NUMBER_OF_PROCESSORS=${number_of_processors:-2}
````

6. Run the [build.sh](build.sh) script.

````
bash build.sh
```` -->

## Verify your build

### Running `tudat` tests

1. Enter the `tudat` build directory
````
cd <build_directory>/tudat
````

2. Run the tests using `ctest` (packaged with CMake)
````
ctest
````

Desired result:
````
..
100% tests passed, 0 tests failed out of 224
Total Test time (real) = 490.77 sec
````

### Running `tudatpy` tests

1. Enter the `tudatpy` build directory
````
cd <build_directory>/tudatpy
````

2. Run the tests using `pytest`
````
pytest
````

Desired result:
````
=========================================== 6 passed in 1.78s ============================================
````

<!-- ## Use your build
The path of the TudatPy kernel that has been manually compiled needs to be added before importing any `tudatpy.kernel` module.
This can be done with the following two lines, with `<kernel_path>` being similar to `<tudat-bundle_path>/build/tudatpy`:
```
import sys
sys.path.insert(0, <kernel_path>)
``` -->

<!-- ## Notes

- [**All Users**] You can increase the number of cores used to compile `tudat` & `tudatpy` using the `-j<n>`
  build argument, but **be aware** that the current complexity of the libraries can often result in your PC freezing indefinitely. -->
